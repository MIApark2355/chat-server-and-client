# chat-server-and-client

**Note to Kaiyue

1. When a creator disconnects(exit the window), rooms that the creator will be removed

2. I think we should make a seperate button for switching room. Switch options will contain rooms that 
a user already joined, while join options will only contain rooms that a user has not joined or left.

3. creative portion idea:
- showing all the users list(online)
- creator can hand over 'creator' authority

**To-do
